## Directives

### modal-select

This directive will transform the element into a modal select: when clicking the element a  dialog will be open. For this to work the following conditions must apply:

* The element you use this directive must be clickable.
* The directive requires ngModel to be set on the element

The final value bound to your model will be determined as follow:

* if you set the attribute `option-getter` will be set as `getterFunction(selectedItem)`
* if you set the attribute `option-property` will be set as `selectedItem[propertyName]`
* otherwise it will be set as the full object
